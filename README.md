This script allows users to extract information about a movie's ratings and details from IMDb.
Specifically, it will find the movie's title, score, genres, description, and a link to its IMDb page.
The data is organized and returned in a comma-separated values file (results.csv). 
Users should list movie titles, with each movie on a new line, in the text file (movies.txt).
